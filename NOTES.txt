NEED TO RE-MAPP EMPLOYEES TO ITERMINATED employees

need a service to create a new Terminated employee and Show a listing of Terminated Employees (maybe SQL Trigger)



I WANT THE ABILITY TO ADD AN EMPLOYEE TO A SPECIFFIC POISTION	

Each department has a list of poistions? Postion -> should be a class

Take Department off IEmployee

User Roles for employees and management


Each department should have own crud... and methods for employees ....

Create Employee Bonus Table -> give out increases in pay
Bonuses are restricted to the position(s)
housekeepers cannot get AnimalCatcher(s) bonuses

WANT A TABLE OF 'UN-HIRED' APPLICANTS
WANT A TABLE OF 'FIRED' APPLICANTS

Method that hides all but the last 4 SSN Numbers

May use IPosition -> IVeterinaryPosition, IDogCathcerPosition to FURTHER create modularity

DO THE HIRING PROCESS FIRST.... TAKE THE APPLICANT FROM THE APPLICANT DBSET AND MOVE IT TO THE HIRED TABLE(Employee Name ,HireDate) [This could be a trigger]
AND MAKE A EMPLOYEE COUNT VARIABLE THAT COUNTS EACH EMPLOYEE???


MAPP APPLICANT to a IEmployee and then assign the applicant(Iemployee) to the nessacery position, subtract from position count


After Employees have been hired and added to a position -> they need to be enlisted into the position via the Job/Controller

Manager(s)/Admin(s) Can see the listing of all employees.
